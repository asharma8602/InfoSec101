Author: [Ashutosh Sharma](https://github.com/asharma8602)

Challenge Page: [Insp3ct0r](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/)

## Walkthrough

Starting from the clicking on the buttons on the webpage which didn't tell much about finding the flag.Next i inspected the source code of the website ,there i got the flag, which was hardcoded into three parts in the HTML CSS JS files.

## Flag

`picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t _lucky?9df7e69a}`

## Useful resources (if any)

Not particularly for this level but i went through some videos on youtube just to see how the thinking process should go for the solving ctfs(some were very cool indeed).

## Suggested modifications [Optional]

What can you do to make this level more difficult. The inherent idea should be similar.
